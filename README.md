1, 2  (omit the words  “The only” )  ,  3  but change to  “both x and y cannot be perfect squares”.   ,11  (again omit  “The only”  )

Additionally:

Use software to investigate the distribution of primes.  Specifically, develop a table showing intervals of length  100, starting at x=0  and going to 1000  (so 10 entries).  The table should show the number of primes in each interval and also the cumulative number of  primes from 2 to the higher end of the interval.  So three columns:




<h1>                          interval             # primes in interval            total primes from 2 to end of interval</h1>

[901,1000]

How many are there between 10,000,001  and 10,000,100   ?

What does all this data suggest?
